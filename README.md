# 45-Day DSA Challenge

Welcome to my 45-Day DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

This challenge is from Arsh Goyal to help improve my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms over a period of 45 days. I'll be working on various problems, learning new concepts, and sharing my progress here.

## Goals

1. **Daily Practice**: Solve at least one DSA problem each day.
2. **Conceptual Understanding**: Learn and understand key concepts and algorithms.
3. **Code Implementation**: Implement the learned algorithms in code.
4. **Documentation**: Document the process, challenges, and solutions.

## Structure

- **Day 1-15**: Focus on basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues).
- **Day 16-30**: Dive into more complex structures (trees, graphs, heaps).
- **Day 31-45**: Explore advanced algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms).

## Daily Progress

I'll be updating this repository daily with:

- **Problem Statements**: Description of the problem I worked on.
- **Solutions**: My code implementation of the solution.
- **Explanation**: A detailed explanation of the approach and algorithm used.
- **Challenges**: Any challenges or difficulties faced during the problem-solving process.

## Resources

I'll be using various resources for this challenge, including:

- **Books**: "Cracking the coding interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
- **Online Platforms**: LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks
- **Tutorials**: YouTube tutorials and online courses
